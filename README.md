================

##This is the repo's README.md file for the Getting and Cleaning Data course, course project Run Analysis:

##I have created one CodeBook.md file that tells you descriptions and definitions of each line's variables, calculations, and conversions.

##I have created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
##Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
##Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
##From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each ##activity and each subject.

##Need to install packages if you do not have them:##Restarting R may be required after installing the packages
##Call needed library packages

##Set working directory

##Read activity labels, features, X and y test data, X and y train data, and subject test and train data, into a table

##Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the test data sets

##Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the train data sets

##Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

##Bind test and train data

##Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

##Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

##From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Output is a tidydata text file, so that you can see the tidy data set.
